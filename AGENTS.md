# Agent instructions — GIS Toolbox

This repository is **GIS-Toolbox.com**: a client-side GIS and data-prep web app (MapLibre, import/export, workflow editor, ArcGIS REST helpers). There is **no build step** and **no `package.json`**; the app is loaded as native ES modules from `index.html`.

## Layout (quick map)

| Area | Role |
|------|------|
| `index.html` | Shell, script tags, UI chrome |
| `js/app.js` | Main wiring and event handlers |
| `js/core/` | State, session, events, errors, logging |
| `js/map/` | MapLibre map, draw tools |
| `js/import/`, `js/export/` | Format handlers |
| `js/dataprep/` | Transforms, templates, undo history |
| `js/workflow/` | Pipeline editor (canvas, nodes, store) |
| `js/arcgis/`, `js/agol/` | ArcGIS Online / REST integration |
| `css/` | `main.css`, `mobile.css`, `workflow.css` |
| `pipelines/` | Saved pipeline JSON + `index.json` |
| `manifest.json`, `sw.js` | PWA manifest and service worker |

## Conventions

- Prefer **small, focused changes**; match existing patterns in nearby files (imports, naming, error handling via `handleError` / toasts).
- Use **ES modules** (`import`/`export`); keep paths explicit (e.g. `./core/logger.js`).
- **Do not** add a bundler or Node-only runtime requirement unless the project explicitly moves that direction.
- Avoid committing **secrets** (API keys, tokens). Use environment-specific config or user-supplied values, not hardcoded credentials.
- Remove stray **`.bak`** files rather than committing them.

## How to run locally

From the repo root:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```

Open `http://localhost:8080/` (browsers restrict some APIs on `file://`, so always use a local server).

There is no automated test suite in-repo today; verify behavior in the browser after substantive UI or map changes.

## Cursor Cloud Agents

- **Environment**: `.cursor/environment.json` defines a lightweight static server and forwarded port for smoke checks in the cloud VM.
- **Persistent guidance**: project rules live under `.cursor/rules/`; this file (`AGENTS.md`) is the human-oriented overview. Keep both aligned when workflows change.
- **GitHub / secrets**: connect the repo and manage Cloud Agent secrets in the [Cursor Cloud Agents dashboard](https://cursor.com/dashboard/cloud-agents); do not put credentials in tracked files.
- **Branches / PRs**: use normal feature branches off `main`, commit in logical chunks, push, and open PRs for review (match your team’s naming conventions).

When cloud-specific steps grow (deploy URLs, staging accounts), add them **here** under this section so agents and humans stay in sync.
